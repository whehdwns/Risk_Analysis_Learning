## Youth Behavior Risk Survey (High School)

The NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is conducted through an ongoing collaboration between the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Department of Education (DOE), and the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The New York City's YRBS is part of the CDC's National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). The survey's primary purpose is to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth in New York City.
